# Ciphers Collection

This repository will contain implementation of various ciphers.

## Currently implemented Ciphers

### Caesar Cipher
The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher that shifts each letter of the plaintext by a fixed number. This implementation supports both uppercase and lowercase letters, and positive shifts.  
[Caesar Cipher Code](./caesar_cipher.cpp)

### Vigenère Cipher
The Vigenère Cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a repeating keyword to determine the shift for each letter of the plaintext. In this implementation, only uppercase letters (A–Z) are supported.
[Vigenère Cipher Code](./vigener_cipher.cpp)
